    1) Normal Css Example 
        nav{
            background-color:red;
        }
        nav ul{
            display:flex;
            justify-content:space-between;
        }
        nav ul li{
            list-style:none;
        }
        nav ul li a{
            text-decoration:none;
            font-size:16px;
        }
        nav ul li a:hover{
            font-size:20px;
        }

    2) Intended (SASS) Example
        nav 
            background-color:red;

            ul 
                display:flex;
                justify-content:space-between;

                li
                    list-style:none;

                    a
                        text-decoration:none;
                        font-size:16px; 
                        &:hover
                            font-size:20px;
        
    3) SCSS extension Example 
        nav{
            background-color:red;
            ul{
                display:flex;
                justify-content:space-between;
                li{
                    list-style:none;
                    a{
                        text-decoration:none;
                        font-size:16px; 
                        &:hover{
                            font-size:20px;
                        }
                    }
